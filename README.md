[App Setup](#app-setup)<br>
[Tech](#tech)

### Goals
The goal was to create a typical todo list, but add features that we usually see in more complex management tools.<br><br>
The base of this project was done with a YouTube tutorial from [Manual do Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@ManualdoDev).
All the aditional features were done by me as a way of improving the original project.

The 3 main goals were:
- Use more advanced JavaScript concepts;
- Learn how to do a simple database to store the tasks;
- Work with new tools/techs - for this project they were Docker, MySQL and Insomina.

## Tech
For this project we used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JSON
- MySQL
- Docker

### App Setup
#### ENV File
If you want to use my project on your side, you will need to create your own env variables. The file env.example shows the structure of the variables you need to create on your .env file

You need to create a database and connect it with your propject as well. You can use some VS Code Extensions for that, such as Database Client and Docker.
